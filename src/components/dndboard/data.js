I think the both the lines for security (getting in) and the lines for the bathroom (particularly for the men’s) could be better managed. For instance, the men’s bathroom line was a approx a 25 minute wait, but once I got to the head of the line I realized that none of the urinals were being used, just the stalls, so the wait was for nothing, all because the people couldn’t see around the corner how much availability there really was.\n\nGood venue, minor improvements suggested.",

          text: "When A Vision Becomes A Reality\n\nThe year 1923, the idea of hosting local and international fairs and events in Israel began circulating in “Little Tel Aviv” in the 1920’s and 1930’s. Endowed with a sense of higher purpose, local private entrepreneurs began producing exhibitions and fairs funded with their own money. Their vision was to develop and cultivate a modest local industry. What started as a small-scale operation gradually grew to impressive proportions and they were looked upon as an opportunity to demonstrate and share with the world success stories from the Zionist movement in many fields such as agriculture, technology, food and more.\nOver the early years, the Fair center had experience ups and down, changed locations until it based it’s final destination on Rokah boulevard.\nToday, Expo Tel Aviv hosts 2.5 million visitors a year and hosts hundreds of exhibitions and conferences & events a year. Overseeing 80 years of lively activities taking place in the center is the “Flying Camel” – which symbolizes both the Middle – East alongside the power of imagination, innovation and creativity.\nWhat began as a modest initiative of a few private entrepreneurs on a mission became over the years a series of enterprises whose influence had expanded beyond the borders of the city and country.",
